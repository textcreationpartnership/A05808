            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in thys prymer were conteyned a greate nomber of vnneceſſary prayers, and ſome very ſuperſtycyous, but in eſpecyall therein was the chefe ſuffrages, that is to ſaye, the matens wyth the houres, euenſonge wyth complene, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to be of oure Lady. For thys cauſe ſo called (as ſome vnlearned hathe bothe fayned and taughte) that ſhe ſhulde vſe to ſaye it, but howe falſe and folyſhe thys is, let the learned iudge, but rather it was ſo called, becauſe that all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themes, hymnes, leſſons, reſponces, chapters, and collectes, were thoughte to be of oure Lady, yet were there many ſcriptures dyſtorted vnto oure Lady, whyche in theyr owne natyue ſence are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge mente of her, but of Chryſt, the wyſedome of the father. As for an example at the fyrſte howe the Chapter is, <hi>in omnibus requiem queſiui,</hi> wrytten Eccleſiaſtici. xxiiii. wyth the chapters of the houres and of complene. For thys cauſe haue I thoughte it my bonde deute towardes Goddes true and ſyncere honoure to ſette forthe ſuche a maner of prymer, wherein myghte be no ſuche di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted ſcrypture or falſe honoure of that mooſte

immaculate mother of God, leaſt the youth ſhuld learnd to take ſuch ſcriptures to be of our Lady, whyche are of God, and to geue ſuch prayſe to her as ſhulde onely be geuen to God, but to knowe fyrſte the true honoure of God, and to knowe the honoure that belongeth to that bleſſed vyrgyne Mary and to the holy ſayntes. And for as much as the prymer is not had in hande of ſo many, but all they, ye euery Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de fyrſt to learne to lede a chriſtian lyfe, therfore haue I here in the proces of thys prymer in maner poynted and ſet forthe the true lyfe of a Chriſtian, that as ofte as he ſhall handell hys prymer, he maye ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne and remember the true lyfe towarde God, whych lyfe conſyſteth princypally and wholy, in fayth, in prayer, and in good workes, and theſe thre are not only taught in the thre leſſons of Matens, but al ſo in the thre partes of thys prymer ſo diuided.

               </gap>nynge workes, as the commaundementes ſet forthe at large wyth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claracyon of the kyndes of workes, theſe haue I ſet out, both in Englyſſhe and Laten for the more parte to thende that the deuoute (for hys choyſe) maye reade whether he wyll. But where there ſhall ſeme to the reader in the Pſalmes ony dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwene the Laten and Englyſſhe, let the ſame remember that the Englyſhe is accordaunte to the Hebraicall Pſalter tranſlated by ſaynt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, and the laten is the vſuall Pſalter, whyche in ſome places are not correſpondent in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thus haue I ioyned them, that ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyteth in the Englyſſhe, myghte haue the playner ſentence, and that the other that readeth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhulde not thynke that we ſhulde brynge in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrannge pſalmony.</p>
            <p>Moreouer where as the Pſalmes and anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, hymnes, leſſons, whyche were ryghte good, are nowe chaunged, thys dyd I, not that I ſhulde thynke them worthy of reieccyon, other that I wolde be noted to be of ſuche rare and excellente

iudgemente, that I wolde correcte the vſe of the church ſo longe continued, but rather thys haue I enterpryſed, becauſe that in the ſayde anthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, hymnes, and leſſons are ſuche ſentences, and in the ſayde pſalmes is ſuche abſcuryte and darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, that the rude and the vnlearned (which hath mooſte the vſe of ſuche kynde of bokes as thys is) myghte not comprehende the miſteryes of them, and here by had the leſſe deuotion, hauynge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe pſalmes, anthemes, leſſons and hymnes of more playne ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they maye better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the ſame, and in vnderſtandynge ſhall haue more contemplacion and deuocion.</p>
            <p>To auoyde prolixite (whyche often tyme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth deuocion) the greate nomber of memoryes of the ſayntes vſed in the Matens, of the whyche ſome doth playnly derogate the honoure of god, is omytted.</p>
            <p>I omytted alſo the greate nomber of ſayntes commenly ſet forth in other prymers in the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not becauſe that I wolde go aboute to teache here in, the people that they ſhulde not praye to ſayntes, other that I do myſtruſt the holynes of the ſayntes, that are here omytted, but that they (accordynge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynges graces iniunction) ſhuld haue the greater deuocion in the ſuffrages that followeth in the letany then in nombrynge ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſayntes.</p>

One of the ſeruauntes of the hyghe preſte (hys conſyne, whoſe eare Peter ſmote of) ſayde vnto hym: Dyd not Iſe the in the garden wyth hym?

Thyne owne nacion and hygh preſtes haue dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the vnto me. What haſt thou done?

For this cauſe was I borne and for this cauſe came I into the worlde, that I ſhulde beare wytnes vnto the truth. And all that are of the trouth heare my voyce. Pylate ſayde vnto him: What thyng is trouth? And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſayd that, he went out agayne vnto the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and ſayd vnto them. I fynde in him no cauſe at all, ye haue a cuſtome, that I ſhuld delyuer you one lowſe at Eaſter. Wyll ye that I lowſe vnto you the kynge of the Iewes? Than cryed they all agayne, ſayenge: Not hym, but Barrabam. That Barrabas was a robber. Then Pylate toke Ieſus and ſcourged hym. And the ſouldiers wounde a crowne of thornes, and put it on his heade. And they dyd on hym a purple garmente, and ſayde: Hayle kyng of the Iewes. And they ſmote hym on the face. Pylate went forth agayne and ſayde vnto them: Beholde, I brynge hym forth to you, that ye maye knowe, that I fynde no faulte in hym. Than came Ieſus forth wearynge a crowne of thorne and a robe of purple, and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſayde vnto them. Beholde the man. Whan

the high preſtes and miniſters ſawe him, they cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, ſayeng, Crucify him, crucify him. Pylate ſayde vnto them. Take ye him and crucify hym. For I fynd no cauſe in him. The Iewes aunſwered hym we haue a lawe, and by oure lawe he oughte to dye bycauſe he made hymſelfe the ſonne of God. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pylate herde that ſayenge: He was the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, and ſayde vnto Ieſus, whence arte thou? But Ieſus gaue hym none aunſwere. Than ſayd Pylate vnto hym: Speakeſt thou not vnto me? Knoweſt thou not that I haue power to crucify the, and I haue power to lowſe the? Ieſus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thou couldeſt haue no power at al againſt me, except it were geuen the from aboue. Therfore he that delyuered me vnto the, is more in ſynne. And from hence forth, ſought Pylate meanes to lowſe hym. But the Iewes cryed, ſayenge. Yf thou let hym go, thou arte not Ceſars frende. For who ſo euer make the hym ſelfe a kynge, is agaynſte Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. Whan Pylate herde that ſayenge, he brought Ieſus for the, and ſat downe to geue ſentence, in a place called the Pauement, but in the Hebrue tongue Gobbatha. It was the Sabboth euen, which falleth in the Eaſter feaſte, and about the Syxte houre. And he ſayde vnto the Iewes: Beholde youre kynge. They cryed, awaye wyth hym, awaye wyth hym, crucyfie hym. Pylate ſayd vnto them. Shall I crucifye your kynge. The high preſtes anſwered we haue no kyng but Ceſar

Than delyuered he him vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be crucyfyed. And they toke Ieſus &amp; led him away.

Wryte not kynge of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, but that he ſayde, I am kynge of the Iewes. Pylate anſwered and ſayd: What I haue wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that haue I wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſold yours wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had crucifyed Ieſus, toke his garmentes &amp; made foure partes, to euery ſouldyer a parte, and alſo his cote. The cote was withoute ſeme, wrought vpon throughout. And they ſayd one to another: Let vs not diuide it, but caſt lottes who ſhalhaue it.

Whan Ieſus ſaw his mother, &amp; the diſciple ſtandynge, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loued, he ſayd vnto his mother: Woman, behold thy ſonne.

<pb facs="tcp:5554:18"/>
And from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciple toke her for his owne. After that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus perceyued that al thynges were performed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſcriptur myght be fulfylled he ſayd: I thyrſt.

But whan they came to Ieſus, &amp; ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legges, but one of the ſouldyers with a ſpeare, thruſte hym into the ſyde, and forthwyth came out bloud &amp; water. And he that ſawe it, bare recorde, &amp; his recorde is true. And he knoweth that he ſayth true, that ye myght beleue alſo.

And agayne an other ſcripture ſayeth: They ſhall loke on hym, whom they pearſed. After that Ioſeph of Aramathia (which was a diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretly for feare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes) beſought Pylate, that he myght take downe the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.

Whiche entrepryſe (gentle readers) I take in hande, not becauſe thynke my ſelfe of ſuch excellent iudgement, and learnynge, that I can exquyſytely and ſuffycyently declare and ſatyſfye the reader of the miſteryes of ſo excellent and hygh ſacrament: but that one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly I wolde ſhewe ſome token of my deuty to my euen Chriſten in the diſtribucion vnto hym of ſuche talent whyche God hath lente me. And fyrſt ſhall I reherſe the ſcriptures whych the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries go aboute to enſtablyſhe theyr hereticall opinion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge the body of Chriſt, preſence of the ſame ſacrament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarynge ſuch places of ſcripture (that they haue choſen) in theyr owne natyue ſence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hereby may appere both y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they diſtort y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture for theyr ſinguler opynio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no leſſe then an hereſy, and therfore vtterly to be forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery true chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dely wyll I inferre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the conſent of a few ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the moſte auncyent Doctours, to the confyrmacion of the vpryght and infallyble truth and veryte. Wyth what euyl ſpirite were they inſpyred and inflated, which to proue that the preſence of the body of Chriſt is not in the ſacrament of chaulter, brought in this texte of Chriſt wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Math. xxiiii. Then yf any man ſhal ſay vnto you, lo here is Chriſt, or there, beleue him not. What readers is ignoraunt to what purpoſe Chriſt ſpake theſe wordes. Chriſt lamentynge the deſolacion and diſtruccion of Ieruſalem which he premoniſhed ſurely to enſue. Mathew .xxiii. The Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les came to him, and deſyred him to knowe what tyme theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhulde come to paſſe. To whome Chriſt made this anſwere. Take hede that no man deceyue you, for there ſhal come many in my name and ſaye: I am Chriſt, and ſo ſhall deceyue many. For Chriſt as a louynge mayſter to his diſciples wyllyng theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the fayth, before ony ſuch temporall trouble, premonyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them, that many falſe Chriſtes, many falſe prophetes ſhulde come, to the intent they ſhuld not be deceyued. Such Antichriſtes of truth, (accordyng to Chriſtes ſayeng) there were as in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the .v. chapter. We read of one Theudas which boaſtyng him ſelfe to be the great Prophete of God, promyſyng great wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thynges, as by his commaundement to deuyde the floude of Iordayne, there cleued vnto hym a nombre of men about. iiii C which he ſhamfully deceyued. Iudas alſo of Galilye, of whom in
<pb facs="tcp:5554:86"/>
the ſame Chapter we read, beynge an auctor of a ſecte, and a falſe teacher drewe many people after him, and brought them to perdi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion. Was not alſo Symon Magus by the meanes that he had bewytched the people, called of the left and the greateſt, the power of god, which is great. Act. viii. Dyd not Herode alſo ſyttyng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iudgement ſeate in his kyngely apparell, and ſettynge forthe himſelfe with a goodly oratyon made to the people, ſo blynded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they toke him as a God. Act. ii. For the whiche he beyng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated and vſurpynge to himſelfe goddes honour, the angel of the LORDE ſmote him and was eaten vp with wormes &amp; ſo dyed. What ſhall I ſtande in the reherſall of many? as of the Sorſerer called Bar Ieſu a falſe Prophete as in the Actes the .v. Chapter doth teſtyfy whiche beynge with Sergius paulus, withſtode the preachyng of Chriſtes name and ſought to turne away Sergius from the fayth, and alſo of certayne other lyke of the which Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus doth make large mencion. Agayn ſuch falſe Chriſtes &amp; falſe prophetes ſpeaketh Chriſt, for well he knewe that after his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion ſuche wolde come in his name and deceyue many for this cauſe ſayde he vnto his Apoſtles (to the intent they ſhuld auoyde them.) Yf any ſaye vnto you: lo here is Chriſt, beleue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, for there ſhall aryſe falſe Chriſtes and falſe Prophetes, and ſhall do great tokens and wonders, inſomuch that yf it were poſſyble the very choſen ſhulde be brought into errour. Beholde nowe gentle readers, and iudge yf this text make ony thyng agaynſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the aulter. But that Chriſte here only premoniſſhed his Apoſtles (as thou mayſt nowe eaſly perceyue) of falſe Chriſtes, and falſe Prophetes, left by them, workyng portantes, wonders and ſygnes, it might haue chaunſed the Apoſtles to haue ben deceyued, and not of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the aulter, for in this texte he mynded nothyng leſſe.</p>
               <p>With this texte ſo and after ſuch a forte diſtorted, they maye proue that Chriſt is not in heauen. For to be in heauen is by a lyke argument (after our maner of ſpech) to ſaye here or ther, then yf a man ſhulde ſaye accordynge to the article of his faythe, that Chriſt is ſyttyng on the right hande of his father, ye ſhuld not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue him, nor yet ſhuld ye beleue Steuen which ſayd as in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the .vii. Chapter doth teſtifye, that he ſawe Ieſus on the ryght
<pb facs="tcp:5554:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hande of God. Thus yf I wolde deuelyſhly wraſt thys texte and wyth carnall reaſons perſwade the ſame, it myght be proued that Chriſt is no where. For yf ye ſaye that Chriſte is in heauen, in the earth, in the ſacrament of the aulter or ony other where, thys texte (as they apply hym) wylleth that you ſhall not be beleued. Yet as the one is abominable hereſye ſo is the other, and the texte maketh as much for the one as for the other.</p>
               <p>Yf we had no more probacion of theyr falſhed but thys, I thynke it were ynough, for he that can brynge no texte truly ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but ſekyth ſome wraſtyng worke, he were to be ſuſpectyd, and it is a vehement ſuſpition that his matter is not good, whych ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth a falſe probacion to mayntayne it, for the truth hath of hir owne, and ſeketh not to make falſehed hyr frende. Yet not in thys texte alone you ſhall only fynde the maynteners of thys opinion worthy to be reprehended, but in many other as in thys texte alſo whych for the ſettynge forth of theyr ſayd opinion, they triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brynge in. Chriſte to hys dyſciples (murmurynge agaynſt the pourynge of the precious oyntment vpon hys heade) ſayd, ye ſhal haue alway the poore wyth you, but me ſhal ye not haue alwayes Yf we ſhall not haue Chriſte alwayes, then is he not in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the aulter, in the whych alwayes we beleue hym to be.</p>
               <p>Yee I wold ſtande in the bare contencion of thys matter, and wolde not laboure to confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the falſhed and ſet forth the truth, I wolde only brynge thys texte of Matth the .xxviii. Chapter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them, whych Chriſt after hys reſurrection ſayd to hys A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and lo (ſayd he) I am wyth you euery daye vnto the ende of the worlde, whych texte as the other ſayeth, that we ſhall not haue Chriſt alwayes, where by they conclude that we haue not Chriſt in the ſacrament of the aulter, euen ſo doth it ſaye that he is wyth vs euery daye vnto the ende of the worlde, where by we maye conclude that he is in the ſacrament of the aulter, and in it beynge preſent wyth vs euery daye vnto the worldes ende. But contencion ſet aparte I wyll as nye as I can come to the pyth of the truth. It is to be noted and vnderſtande that Chriſt (as I ſay in the .xiii. Chapter of hym dyd prophecy as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernynge hys fyrſt ſtate in the manhode was the mooſte ſymple and diſpyſed of all
<pb facs="tcp:5554:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whyche had good experience of ſorowes and infirmities whyche ſhulde be rekened ſo ſymple and ſo vyle that ſome ſhuld hyde theyr faces from hym, whoſe pouertye in that eſtate was ſuche that as he hymſelfe doth teſtifye Luke .ix. he had no place to put hys heade in, for whoſe infyrme condicion &amp; lowe eſtate. Paule to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppians declarynge the complyſhment of I ſayes prophecye, teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyeth that he made hymſelfe of no reputacion, and toke vpon hym the nature of a ſeruaunt, became lyke another man, &amp; was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in hys ſhape as a man, he humbled hymſelfe and became obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the death, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of the Croſſe, ſo that Chriſt in thys eſtate was full of infyrmities, was paſſible &amp; mortall (in al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as Paule ſayeth founde as man) onely that in hym was no ſynne. Wherfore when the diſciples murmured that Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dalene dyd poure the ſwete and precious oyntment vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtes heade, he ſayde: Ye ſhall haue poore men wyth you alwayes, to whome whan yelyſt ye maye do good, but me a poore man and a paſſible man (as I am now) to whome you may do ſuche corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obſequye, you ſhall not haue alwayes. For Chriſte after hys reſurreccion had no mortall body, no paſſible body, no bodye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued or infected wyth infirmities, but he had then an immortall body, an impaſſible body, and a glorifyed body, in the whyche bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he beynge preſent wyth hys diſciples, and ſpeakynge wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, counted hym as though he had not ben w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as Luke .xxiiii. reherſeth he ſayde: theſe be the wordes whych I ſpake vnto you whyle I was yet wyth you. For it muſt be all fulfylled that was wrytten of me in the lawe of Moyſes, in the Prophetes, and in the Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>Note deligently how Chriſte ſayeth whyle I was wyth you, countynge hym ſelfe not then to be wyth them, wyth whome he was preſent, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he then ſpake bycauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had not a ſuch lyke body, whych then indued wyth infyrmityes, as theyrs were, but an immortall and inpaſſible body. By thys texte euydentlye may be proued the ryght &amp; true vnderſtandynge of the other texte, whych they falſly do allege, whych is that Chriſt is not, nor wyl be wyth vs alwayes wyth a preſence of a mortall body, or of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte body. But he is wyth vs by hys power and wyth a preſence
<pb facs="tcp:5554:88"/>
of an immortall body.</p>
               <p>What ſhulde I ſtande in reherſall of many of theyr wreſted aucthorities, which a very yong reader may ſone deprehend that they are not taken in theyr natyue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Yf the places of theyr auc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torities be ſo exyle and feble, much more is theyr carnall &amp; blynde reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which take none effecte in matters of fayth) are very feble. Wherfore I thynke it but waſt labour to reherſe any more of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeynge they are but freuolous and maye ſone be aſſoyled of any true chriſtian. Yet theſe to reherſe I haue thought it expedient, to the intent that the reader maye knowe and perceyue by wraſtyng of theſe auctorities, that al the other that they alleage for this pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe be of lyke condicion. Wherfore yf ther be any auctoryte or re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon brought or made agaynſt you, ſuſpecte it and thynke (as you maye very well) that it is falſe though you for lacke of learnyng or knowledge can not deprehende the falſhed therof, or diſcuſſe the partes of it.</p>
               <p>The truth of this, is, and hath ben euer ſence Chriſtes ſupper certaynly euident and voyde of al doute to the, which with meke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe do reade the ſcriptures, deferrynge the power of theyr owne wyttes, and wholy commyttyng them ſelues and theyr vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng to god, and to the inſtruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the grace of his holy ſpirite. For in the vnderſtandyng of the ſcriptures all fantaſies, quyddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and inuencions of mens braynes (in the whiche ſome of late dayes to depely haue laboured) repelled and forſaken, in whoſe place are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtanciall truth, ſimplicite, &amp; goddes grace to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued &amp; amplexed chriſtes wordes ſyncerly to interpretate. They were to nyſe in theyr prety lytle fayth which ſo properly denyenge the poſſibilyte of Goddes power enterpryſed with a quydditye to chaunge Chriſtes worde, that where as Chriſt ſayd by manyfeſt ſentence, This is my body. They ſaye that he wolde haue ſayde, this ſignifyeth my body. But Chriſt at that tyme was no babe, he coulde well ſpeake that, that he meaned or thought, ſpecially to his Apoſtles, to whome it was geuen to knowe the miſteries of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kyngdom of god. Luc. viii. And to whom he vſed no parables, but expounded of his owne mouth. Or els they were very nye of Chriſtes councell, when they can (at the leaſt) they take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to knowe Chriſtes thought hauyng no parte of his worde to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb facs="tcp:5554:88"/>
the ſame to them, yee they ſeme to make Chriſt ſuch one that he wolde ſaye one thynge and thynke another, and in concluſion his word to be clene contrary to his thought. What ſhuld I ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de ſo long in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futacion of theyr vayn reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this lytle thyng, which (deare reader) I ſet forth only for a monicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch hereſies and for a confirmacion of the truth to the vnlearned, that they by this maye learne to beware of theyr deuelyſſh reaſons, and be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed in the true waye, and be enſtablyſhed in the ſame. And not for an abſolute or exquiſyte worke which aſketh much more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and wyſdome in ſentence then I haue here expreſſed. Yet notwithſtanding for the fauour of the vpright truth and ſettyng forth of the ſame (all theyr heretical inuencions and tryflyng rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons omytted and ſet aparte) I wyll in this matter ſet forth groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; playnly that I maye inſtruct the rude by Chriſtes acte, word and learnyng.</p>
               <p>Fyrſt as ſaynt Paule ſayeth: The ſhadowes and figures are gone and we haue the bodye, we haue not therfore the fygure of Chriſtes body and bloud but the ſelfe ſame thyng. Exodi. xvi. We haue not Manna as the Iewes had in deſerte: We haue not the ſhewe bread of the Temple, for that manufact temple and the gol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den table are paſſed. We haue not the bread that Hely had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the aungell which ſtrengthed him forty dayes .iii. Reg. xix. Neyther haue we the bread and wyne that Melchyſidech the preſt of the hyeſt offered vnto Abraham. Gene. xiiii. For theſe are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and gone afore as ſhadowes and figures, and in theyr ſtedes haue ſucceded the veryte, for Chriſte hath fulfylled all the lawe &amp; prophetes (that were of hym) in hymſelfe and his actes, why then ſhuld we abyde any mo fygures of him, except the eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our church be no perfecter then the Iewes ſinagoge which had nothyng but fygures, but that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be. Wherfore I let paſſe this Iewes interpretacion of Chriſtes wordes with all theyr fygu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res and wyl declare by theſe wordes, the acte, &amp; learning of Chriſt that in that moſt bleſſed Sacrament is (not as in a fygure) the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry body and bloud of Chriſt. For he beyng the wyſdom of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and very God, equall with the father knowyng all thynges to come, by his euerlaſtyng knowledge, he perceyued the tyme to draw neare in the which he wolde ſuffre, he ſayd to his diſciples.
<pb facs="tcp:5554:89"/>
Mat. xxvi. Ye knowe that after two dayes ſhalbe eaſter, and the ſonne of man ſhalbe delyuered, to be crucifyed. And I haue herte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſyred to eate thys eaſter lambe with you before I ſuffre. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſyttynge with his apoſtles toke the breade gaue thankes, and brake it and gaue it to the diſciples and ſayde: Take, eate thys is my body. And he toke the cuppe and thanked, and gaue it them, &amp; ſayde: Drynke ye all therof. Thys is my bloude of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhalbe ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſynnes. This do in the remembraunce of me. Theſe wordes marke well and let no vayne nor carnall reaſon ſeduce the. But let fayth be thy guyde in thys matter for reaſon can not apprehende the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of fayth, for fayth is aboue reaſon it excedeth reaſon, it depen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth not of reaſon. Fayth as ſaynt Paule Heb. ii. doth defyne, is a ſure confidence of thynges whych are hoped for, and a certaynte of thynges which are not ſene. Which fayth alſo as ſaynte Paule doth teſtifye. Rom. x. commeth vnto vs by hearynge, and hearyng commeth by the worde of God. Thy reaſon and wytte therfore captyue in the obſequy of Chriſte, and ſtyre vp and quycken thy fayth by the hearynge of the worde of God. The worde of God as it is aboue mencioned doth declare that Chriſte takynge the breade ſayde it was his body. Seynge then that gods worde dothe ſaye that Chriſt dyd tranſmute the ſubſtaunce of the breade into hys body. Geue a fayth to it though reaſon can not attayne the knowlege of it, and ceaſe accordynge to reſons motion, to queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Caphernaites dyd. When they aſked of Chriſte, howe can thys man geue vs hys fleſhe to eate, for ther is nothynpe vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to god. In theſe wordes of Chriſt thou mayeſt note the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of the conſecracion of the body of Chriſte, and the auctoure and founder of the ſame. The auctoure and founder of the ſame was no lyghte fantaſyed man. He was no lyenge man, he was no man that by ſettynge forthe of a newe ſecte or of a newe opinion ſoughte hys owne glorye. But it was Ieſus Chriſt, the ſonne of the eternall lyuynge God, God and man, in whom was euerlaſtynge wyſedom wythout decaye. Euerlaſtyng conſtancy wythout mutabilite, he beynge not only true, but alſo the very truthe, whome the voyce of the father from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen dyd commende ſayenge: Thys is my deare ſonne in
<pb facs="tcp:5554:89"/>
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I delyte, heare hym. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore Chriſt beyng both true &amp; the very truth in whom was no doublenes of ſpech, but playnes and ſimplicite, whom the father ſpeakyng from heuen wylled vs to heare) takyng the bread and bleſſyng it, ſayd: This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and bleſſyng the cup, ſayd: Thys is my bloud. We ought as Chriſt is playne, true, and wythout doublenes, ſo wythout tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys, methaphors, ſimilitudes, ſignifycacions and all other crafty quyddities and logicall intencions, playnly, truly, and without doublenes to take and receaue the wordes as Chriſt hath ſpoken them. Chriſt playnly by demonſtracion takyng the bread, ſayde: This is my body. What ſhuld we then enterpryſe to ſay agaynſt hym that there was not his body. The inſtitution then of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecracion of the body of Chriſt, was by the worde of Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: This is my body. This body, in the forme of bread of Chriſt conſecrated (for as much as he was then departynge from them: and from theyr eyes) that mortall and ſenſible body ſhuld be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, he diſtrybuted then beyng preſent wyth them his bodye in that forme and ſort, of the which after his departyng they ſhuld take no miſtruſt. But that by theyr fayth they myght ſe hym al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſent. By the which they ſhuld take comforte and alſo by the contemplacion of that alwayes to haue a freſſh memoriall or remembraunce of his paſſion and death. Wherfore he ſayd to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lu. xxii. This do you in the remembraunce of me. In theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des we are not only monyſhed to haue a contynual remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſtes death, but alſo it is omytted vs (as for a cauſe of that ſame remembraunce. For Chriſte ſayde (hoc facite. This do you. Obſerue therfore diligent reader and note that Chriſt had (as I haue aboue ſayde) geuen them his body they receyued it, he wylled them that they ſhulde do it in the remembraunce of hym. What ſhuld they do? that they receyued at Chriſtes hand. What receyued they at Chriſties hand? they receyued his very body.</p>
               <p>Then Chriſt wold they ſhuld do this, that is to receyue his body (and not only a pece of bread) in the remembraunce of him.

Actu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. xxii, That the very body of Chriſt was receyued of the Apoſtles and of other Chriſtians after that he was aſcended it is manifeſt not onely in the Actes of the Apoſtles but alſo in other places, as namely fyrſt, in the fyrſt epiſtle of Saynt Paule to the Corinthians. In the which place Saynt Paule exortynge them from ydolatry certyfyeth them that as yet the hath no te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion ouertaken them, but ſuch as foloweth the nature of man. Wherfore he wylleth them not only to flye from ydolatry, but al ſo from the partakyng of ydolatytes, that is from ſuch meates as were offred to ydols. Which vyce he counteth not to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the nature of man, but rather to come of deuelyſſh malyte. Now to auoyde the partakyng of ydolatytes. He compareth or rather maketh aſimilitude of the LORDES table, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the deuell, declaryng that as the partakers of the body of Chriſt are one body in Chriſt, ſo the partakers of ydolatytes be one body in the deuell, and begynneth his purpoſe after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wherfore my dearly beloued flye from ydolatrye or flye from the worſhyppyng of ydols. I ſpeake (ſayeth he) vnto them which haue diſcrecion. Iudge ye what I ſaye, the cuppe of thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyuyng, wherwith we geue thankes, is it not the partakyng of the bloud of Chriſt? The bread that we breake is it not the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>takyng of the body of Chriſt? For we many are one breade and one body, in as muche as we all are partakers of one breade. For the profe of his ſentence, that is that the receyuers of the one or of the other are in the felowſhyp of the ſame, he ſayeth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde Iſraell after the fleſſhe. They that eate the ſacrifyces are not they partakees of the aulter. And then he cometh to the other party, in the which after he had declared that the offrynges of the Heathen were to deuels and not to God. He ſayeth nowe wold I not that ye ſhuld be in the felowſhyppe of deuels. And why? Bycauſe theſe can not ſtande togyther and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly he ſayeth: Ye can not drynke of the cuppe of the LORDE
<pb facs="tcp:5554:90"/>
and of the cuppe of the deuels, ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be partakers of the LOR<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>DES table and of the table of the deuels. So nowe deare reader, what expreſſe ſentence Paule hath wrytten of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt which after my cenſure is of ſuche ſtrength for the preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, that it can not be iuſtlye reſyſted. Yet not withſtandynge yf ye luſte not to geue credyte to my exyle and weke iudgement, geue crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the iudgement of Chriſoſtome, Ierome, Ambroſe, Theophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacte, Thomas, and Eraſmus, which expoundyng this place I am ſure do take Saynt Paule here to haue ſpoken of the bodye and bloud of Chriſt. Whoſe ſentences I wold haue here infer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, but for auoydyng of prolixite, let the learned ſearch the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and trye the truth. In the ſecond chapter to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Saynt Paule alſo after he had rebuked the enormityes and abuſes of the Corinthians about the receyuyng of the body of Chriſt, he taught them the true vſe of it. In the ſettyng forth of the which he maketh a very euydent mencion of the ſame body of Chriſt, which document and learnyng, which ordinaunces al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo that he delyuered them, he certifyeth them that he receyued it of the LORDE, after the reherſall of the wordes of Chriſt which I deſyre the diligent reader there to reade, he doth inferre godly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicions for the receyuyng of the body of Chriſt and declareth the daunger of the euell receyuer, ſayeng: Who ſo euer ſhal eate of this bread and drynke of this cuppe of the LORDE vnworthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhalbe gylty of the body and bloud of the LORDE. But let a man examyne him ſelfe and ſo let him eate of thys breade and drynke of this cuppe. For he that eateth and drynketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely, eateth and drynkethe his owne dampnacion, bycauſe he maketh no difference of the LORDES bodye. I can not a lytle meruayle that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo malyciouſly and erroniouſly wyl fal from the trueth hauynge ſuche a clere ſentence of Saynt Paule which ſo manifeſtly doth declare and open the veryte of the body of Chriſte in the Sacramente, that to a Chriſtian reader as I ſuppoſe there is no doute nor diffycultye as concernynge hys fayth in this matter left vndeſolued.
<pb facs="tcp:5554:91"/>
Yet althoughe thys place be ſo good, and full of ſtrengthleſt? ſhulde offende wyth prolixite, or diſcorage wyth tediouſnes brefly nothynge with me two thynges in S. Paule, I hertely deſyre you pondre hys ſentence. Fyrſte note that where as ſaynt Paule in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begynnyng of his ſentence, ſpeakynge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament, accordynge to our ſenſible knowlege doth call that breade, in the ende of the ſentence as an expoſicion to hys fyrſt worde calleth it the body &amp; bloude of Chriſt. And in the laſt ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce where that he ſayeth that the vnworthy receauer of the bread, doth receaue it to hys dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, ſubuertynge the cauſe addeth an expoſicion of hys worde and ſayeth: Becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lordes bodye. Note then and beholde that S. Paule dothe not call the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely bread. But alſo namynge the ſame calleth it the body and bloude of the Lorde and the LORDES body. So breade it maye be called accordynge to our ſenſible knowlege, for we ſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge but bread, we taſt nothynge but breade, we fele nothynge but breade, but by faythe we beleue the bodye of Chriſte and no bread, for bread hath no place wyth the body of Chriſte. The other that I do note is of the vnworthynes of the receauyng, and of the paynes taxed for the ſame S. Paule counceleth the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of thys ſacrament to examen themſelues left they ſhulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it vnworthelye, for in ſo doynge they ſhall receaue it to theyr damnacion, and be gyltye of the bodye and bloude of the LORDE, becauſe they make no difference of the body of the LORDE. Now yf ther be not the body of Chriſte in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the alter, why dothe Paule councell the receauers to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men themſelues? ſhulde they do for to eate a pece of bread? Or why more for the eatynge of thys breade, then of other bread. Further how ſhuld a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eate a pece of bread vnworthely? except ye wyl ſay that he hath taken exceſſe of it, or as the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayenge is that a man is vnworthy to eate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread becauſe he laboureth not for it which vnworthynes taketh no place here in thys matter. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer yf ther be not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Chriſt but breade, why ſhuld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers for the receauynge of a pece of bread be gylty of the body and bloude of the LORDE? And how ſhulde they receaue it to theyr dampnacion? There is no comparyſon betwexte the facte and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> payne, yf it be nothynge but breade, I ſuppoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the iuſtice of god
<pb facs="tcp:5554:91"/>
wyll not make a man gylty of the bodye and bloude of the Lorde for eatyng of a pece of bread, wythout an ordinaunce or a law go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng before. Alſo howe in the receyuyng of a pece of bread ſhuld the reaceyuers make difference of the body of the Lorde, yf the body of the LORDE be not there. But for as much as S, Paule willeth vs not to receyue the Sacrament vnworthely, for yf we do, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue it to our da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bycauſe we make no dyffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> LORD. I take it that in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the aulter is the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry body of Chriſt, in the reſpect of whom we receyue it worthely or vnworthely, and by whoſe preſence yf we receyue it with the ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amynacion of our ſelues, we make a dyfference of the body of the LORDE. And for as much as Chriſt bleſſyng the bread, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng it to his Apoſtles, ſayd: This is my body. I beleue that in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is his body, for ſure I am that he (beyng the truth) can not lye. Yet for aſ much as the malyce of hereſy is not ſo ſone quenched, but alwayes ſeketh to withſtand the truth, and peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture as the Phariſyes dyd agaynſt Chriſt, not hauyng what to ſaye to hym, fel to calumniacion. So wyll they yet, and wyll ſaye although it hath ben ſo taken for a ſmale tyme, yet we haue ſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the prymatyue church. Therfore we ſhall here inferre the ſentences of ſome of the eldeſt and moſt auncient Doctours of the church, which were very nygh to the primatyue church, by whoſe vniforme conſent we maye perceyue the trouth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be the ſurer. Tertullyan one of the auncient wryters of Chriſtes church nexte to the Apoſtles agaynſt Marcio an here lyke ſayth theſe wordes.

Yf this auncient wryter beyng ſo nygh to the pryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue church which knewe the very truth as it was receyued of the Apoſtles. And knewe alſo howe they dyd, ſayth confyrmably to our fayth, &amp; to our vnderſtandyng of the ſcripture it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that we are in a good way and that we truly do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretate the ſcripture although a ſorte whotelynges thynke the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary.

there is plentye) he hathe thys ſentence. Chriſte thys ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment ſometyme doth call hys body, ſometyme hys fleſhe &amp; bloude ſomtyme bread. Thys commen bread y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaunged into fleſh and bloude doth procure lyfe. &amp;c. Although thys is very manifeſtly ſpoken, yet more playnlyer he ſpeketh in another ſentence. Thys bread (ſayeth he) that the Lorde gaue vnto his diſciples throughe the omnipotency of the worde chaunged not in figure or in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde forme but in nature is made fleſh and as in the perſon of Chriſt the manhode was ſeue and the Godhed hyd ſo in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacramente the deuyne nature inuiſible infundeth hymſelfe to the intente that vnto the Chriſtian religion about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ſhulde be deuotion. Is not thys as playnly ſpoken as any man can ſpeake: To thys man beynge ſo auncient an holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, we ſhuld and ought to gyue credence before. v C. Swynglins or any ſuch other. Yet that we maye ſe the argument of many good men which yet were in dyuers tymes ſome other ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyted S. Ambroſe differreth not in ſentence from theſe, he ſayde: Becauſe that by the death of the LORDE we are delyuered of it we declare oure ſelues to be myndefull in that we eate his bodye and drynke hys bloude whych were offred for vs. In the .vi. boke of the ſacramentes, he doth treate of the ſame alſo. He alſo ſayeth: yf the worde of Helyas was of ſuch power that he cauſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre to come downe from heauen. Shall not the worde of Chriſt be of ſuch power that it ſhal chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the ſubſtaunce of thynges (that is) the ſubſtaunce of breade &amp; wyne into the ſubſtaunce of hys bodye and bloude. It is rede of all the workes of the worlde that he ſayde the word, &amp; they were made. Therfore the worde of God (that is) the ſonne of God whyche coulde of nothynge make all thynges that were, can not he chaſige the thynges that be into it that they were not? Thou ſeeſt gentle reader the ſentence of S. Ambroſe, thou mayeſt perceaue that he agreeth wyth thother. S. Hierome alſo a man both of great learnynge, and holynes, diſſenteth not from thys doctryne, he ſayeth: After that the figuratyue Eaſter was fulfylled, and Chryſte wyth hys Apoſtles hadde eaten the Eaſterlambe he toke the breade whych conforteth the herte of man and went to the true Sacrament of Eaſter that euen, as in the
<pb facs="tcp:5554:92"/>
prefiguracion of hym Melchyſedech the preſte of the hygh God dyd, offrynge bread and wyne, he alſo wolde ſet forth the truthe of his body and bloud. Saynt Auſten alſo a famouſe man bothe of lyfe and of lernyng varyeth not from thoſe men, but ſaythe, thys in the forme of breade &amp; wyne, whych we ſe we do honour thynges that we do not ſe (that is) the body and bloude of Chriſt. Beholde the ſentences both faythfull and godly, And for as muche as the wrytters of them were men to be reputed and not diſdayned, eſteme them of authorite. S. Gregory alſo a man of good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye followed the ſame trade, ſayenge: As the diuinitie of the worde doth fyll all the worlde ſo in many places is the body of Chriſte conſecrated and yet be there not many bodyes of Chriſte, but one body and one bloude. Euſebius Emiſenus alſo a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be deſpyſed, ſayth thys: The inuiſible preſt with his worde by a ſecret power doth chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible creatures into the ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of hys body and bloude, pondre nowe gentle readers the vnyfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me conſent of theſe doctours which (as for a certayne of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe they were in dyuers tymes and contryes yet the holy gooſt theyr ſcole mayſter and the mayſter of truth taught them all (as concernynge the poyntes of our fayth) one leſſon of truth. So that they all do agre in thys truth, that in the Sacrament of the aulter is the very body of Chriſte. Many mo mayebe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed that do agre in thys poynte whyche playnly were ynough to fyll a hole boke. Therfore ſhall they be omytted truſtynge that theſe fewe (yf theyr auncient holynes and learnynge be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) with the places of ſcripture aboue reherſed are ſufficiente to ſtaye a Chriſtians herte yf he be not already drowned in here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye. Seyng then that the ſcriptures which can not be but one, and theſe famouſe doctours agreyng to the ſame do teache that in the ſacrament of the aulter is the body of Chriſte.

<pb facs="tcp:5554:118"/>
church for the people to praye, certayne of ceremonies about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtracions of the ſacrament with ſuche other, for the receyuynge of the which and ſuche other lyke S. Peter geueth vs counſell, ſayeng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Submyt your ſelfe vnto all maner of ordinaunce of men for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes ſake, for the ordinaunces of men accordyng to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicion of men, and the tyme are very expedient. Wherfore Paule among the corinthians made many ordinaunces, as that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld not praye or prophecy hauyng ony thyng vpon his heade, and that no woman ſhuld praye or prophecy with an vncouered head: That they ſhuld come to the ſuppers of the lorde in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, and that in the congregacion they ſhuld not all prophecye at ones, but that one ſhuld prophecy after another, that wyues ſhuld kepe ſylence in the congregacion, for it becometh not women to ſpeake in the congregacion. And for a concluſion he ſayeth, let all thynges be done honeſtly, and in ordre, yf then Paule made ſuch tradicions among the Corinthians, ſuch maye be made amonge vs, and as he made them to be obſerued, ſo ought this lawful ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunces to be obſerued. But as Paule dyd not commaunde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be obſerued as workes of righteouſnes, but as comly ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as concernyng a poletyke ordre, ſo ought the tradicions nowe receyued in the church to be obſerued as cyuyle pollyces, and not as workes of righteouſnes. Wherfore the ſuperſticious holynes of many maye here well be noted, which alwayes thought them ſelues very holy, yf they obſerued ſuche cyuyle ordinaunces, the commaundementes of God neglected. Was that not counted holynes euery ſondaye to receyue holy breade faſtyng, was not he counted holy that wold faſt euery ſayntes euen, and kepe the daye holy (as they call it) that is to put on the beſt garmentes, &amp; be ydle al the daye or els geue themſelfe to abhominacion. Were not theſe more regarded, or maye I ſaye be they not nowe better eſtemed then the commaundementes of God. The faſtynge dayes and holydayes, be they not euery ſondaye in the churche proclamed, the commaundementes of god tyll theſe latter dayes not one daye ſpoken of, for holydayes and faſtyng dayes the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple diligently enquired of theyr curates, bycauſe they haue a fere of the breakyng of them, but of the commaundementes of God they nothynge requyre becauſe they regard not the tranſgreſſion of them. There is a great nombre that maketh great daunger
<pb facs="tcp:5554:118"/>
to eate whyte meate in lente, yet they make ſmale daunger to tranſgreſſe gods commaundement. Theſe thynges are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſed (gentle reader) to the intent that ſuch tradicions ſhulde be vtterly contemned, but to ſhewe the abuſe how they are more eſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, then the true holynes of an chriſten mans lyfe, whyche is to be collocate in the fayth of Chriſt and the commaundementes of God, but theſe were preferred before gods commaundementes in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eſtimation, yet playnly they are but trefels to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, for as God is aboue man, ſo is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes aboue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of men. Regarde Gods commaundementes aboue all mans tradicions, yet receaue and obſerue mens trady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that be lawfull, but much more receaue and obſerue fyrſte Goddes commaundementes, and then the lawfull tradycyons of the heades. For Chriſte rebuked not the Pharyſes becauſe they dyd obſerue the ſmaller thynges of the lawe, but that they ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeruynge them, dyd omytte the greater thynges of the lawe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge: Wo be vnto you Pharyſes, and Scrybes, ye ypocrytes, whych tyth mynte anyſe and commyne, and leaue the wayghter matters of the lawe behynde, namely: iudgemente, mercye and faythe, theſe ought to haue ben done and not to leaue the other be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hynde, leaue not then the commaundementes of God. But let them (for as much as they are the wayghter dedes) be fyrſte obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; done, &amp; the other alſo as it is before ſayd: not to be omytted, as Paule counceleth. Let euery ſoule ſubmytte hymſelfe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>torite of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hyer powers, for ther is no power but of god, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be are ordeyned of God, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who ſo euer reſyſteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> powers reſyſteth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordynau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, &amp; they that reſyſt ſhall receaue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Be yet aduertyſed gentle reader that thou putte no truſt in thoſe workes, no nor yet in the externe workes of Goddes commaundementes to be iuſtifyed by them only, but rather becauſe that they come of fayth are they accepted for of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly workes is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtifyed, alſo Dauid ſayeth: Enter not into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with thy ſeruaunt, for in thy ſyght ſhall no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyuyng be iuſtifyed. By the dedes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law no fleſh maye be iuſtifyed in his ſyght. The kyndnes &amp; loue of God our ſaueour to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>warde, hath appeared not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dedes of ryghteouſnes which we wrought
<pb facs="tcp:5554:119"/>
but of his mercy he ſaued vs. &amp;c. When ye haue done all theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges whieh are commaunded you, ſaye we are vnprophetable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, we haue done which was our deuty to do.</p>
               <p>Theſe places w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other that myght be here inferred which now to auoyd prolixite are omytted do manifeſtly wytnes, that by workes is no man ſaued, yet be not diſcoraged, nother ſaye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy ſelfe, what ſhal I do good workes ſeyng I ſhal not be ſaued by them, then they wyll do no good. Many thynges moueth a true chriſtian to worke fyrſt his fayth, for as the tre can not brynge forth fruyt, yf he hath lyfe in hym, ſo can not the faythfull, but bryng forth good workes, yf he haue a perfect fayth in him, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore yf that, thou worke not be aſſured that thou lackeſt faythe, a perfecte fayth ſeaſeth not from workes.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtian alſo ſhulde worke to geue enſample as in the fyfte of Mathewe Chriſt ſayeth: Let your lyght ſo ſhyne before men, that they maye ſe your good workes &amp; gloryfy your father which is in heauen, ſe that ye haue honeſt conuerſacion among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, that they whiche backbyte you as euyll doers mayeſe your good workes and prayſe god in the daye of viſitacion.</p>
               <p>Itt moueth alſo a chriſtian to worke that bytwyxt god and vs is a couenaunt made, that he ſhall reward not for the dignite or worthines of the worke but for his couenauntes ſake, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thynes of the worke doth not receyue ſuch a reward when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde is an hundreth folde better then the worke in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of Chriſt, as whoſoeuer forſaketh houſes, or brethren, or ſyſters, other father, or mother, or wyfe, or chyldren, or lande, for my names ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame ſhal recyue an hundreth folde, and ſhalt inheryte euerlaſtyng lyfe. Many are the conuenauntes made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twyxt god and vs, and when Chriſt ſayd: happy are the mercyful for they ſhall obtayne mercye. Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirite for theyrs is the kyngdome of heauen. &amp;c. Yf ye ſhall forgeue other men theyr treſpaſſes, your heuenly father ſhal alſo forgeue you. Yf thou wylt entre into lyfe, kepe the commaundementes, by theſe conuenauntes thou mayſt perceyue (Chriſtian reader) that vnto worke is a rewarde promyſed by conuenaunt. Wherfore yf thou delyte to worke for a reward, be of good there and ceaſe not to worke thou ſhalt haue a rewarde, not for thy merites deſertes or worthynes of thy worke (as is before ſayde) but for thy conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes
<pb facs="tcp:5554:119"/>
ſake.</p>
               <p>But the chefe motyue to good workes is or ſhalbe the very pure loue of God, for vpon loue doth Chriſt founde the obſeruacion of his commaundementes, as it may be gathered by his ſayenge: yf ye loue me, kepe my commaundementes. So then the obſeruacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes is the effecte of the loue of god, as in the ſame chapter it is expreſſed of Chriſt ſayeng. He that hath my commaundementes and kepeth them, the ſame is he that loueth me. So that a true chriſtian ought to do good workes, not for the loue of eternal lyfe, nother for the feare of eternal death, which enſueth the tranſgreſſion of goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes, but for the very loue of God which fayth hath wrought in him. By this it may be perceyued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although by fayth onely, &amp; not by workes ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iuſtifyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſyght of god, yet good workes are not thought to be deſpyſed, and that man ſhuld not worke (as ſom falſly hath im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted to preachers) but rather that all good workes ſhalbe beſely exercyſed to the glory of god.</p>
               <p>The thyrde ſort of workes are of the tradicion of man, whiche are not in the ſcrypture of God, nor yet conſonaunt to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of god, but playnly repugnaunt, as pardons, pylgrymages, kiſſing of ymages, offryng of candels, knelyng and crouchyng to ſtockes and ſtones, and ſuche other whiche ought not to be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor obſerued, for it is rather to be obeyed to god the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Actes. v. the aucthours of ſuch tradicions, as Chriſt ſayeth doth worſhyp hym in vayne teachyng doctrynes, which are nothynge but mennes preceptes. Mat. xv. Of theſe preceptes and mennes lawes, ſeke the .xxviii. and .xxix. chapter of Eſay, in the whiche ye ſhall perceyue theſe pleaſures of God for them.</p>
